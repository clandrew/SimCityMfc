# SimCityMfc
This is a school project from long ago, created using Visual C++ 6.0 with MFC. At the time I was trying to do two things: learn C++ language, and Windows programming. I recall getting a good mark on the project as well as having a really good time working on it. I made the program to look like SimCity for the SNES, a game I liked playing at the time. 

**Running the release**

The release is a standalone binary. Since all the image elements are set up as resources, they are built into the binary.

**Usage environment**

This program is for Windows 7/Windows 10+ x86-compatible environments.

**Build**

Incredibly, the VC++ 6.0 DSW (project file) was auto-converted to a workable Visual Studio 2017 solution. I built it using Visual Studio 15.7.5. You can build the .sln and run the result in a modern environment.
